Steel Tank is my attempt to fulfill a dream I had once. It's an amalgamation of the games Iron Tank for NES and Combat for Atari 2600. 

The goals of this project are:

*) Make a fun game
*) Make something reminiscent of Iron Tank and Combat
*) Make a game which allows as many players to play at once as possible

For example, if you have one computer and 4 controllers, you should be able to have 4 players play at once on the one monitor. If you have 2 monitors, you should be able to have 2 players for each monitor, and so on. For the most part, this is already accomplished by this project.

In addition to this, it you should be able to utilize multiple computers over a network. If you have 8 controllers, 4 monitors, and 2 computers, you should be able to all play together with these resources pooled. Networking capability has not been accomplished.

This game was originally created on Windows Vista using Visual Studio 2010. However, as a design goal, it should be buildable on other systems one day.
